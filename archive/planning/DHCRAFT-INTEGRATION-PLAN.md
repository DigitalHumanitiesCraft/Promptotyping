# DHCraft.org Promptotyping Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

The DHCraft.org approach to Promptotyping, developed in the context of Digital Humanities projects (particularly the Stefan Zweig Digital project), offers complementary insights to our methodology. Their focus on **Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop** and **Scholar-Centred Design** provides valuable enhancements, especially for academic and research contexts.

## Key Concepts from DHCraft to Integrate

### 1. **Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL)**
**DHCraft Concept:** Combines critical-epistemological and critical-technical reflection
**Our Current Approach:** Expert-in-the-Loop validation at checkpoints
**Integration:** Enhance our expert validation with continuous critical reflection throughout all phases

### 2. **Scholar-Centred Design**
**DHCraft Concept:** Considers epistemological requirements of researchers
**Our Current Approach:** General software engineering focus
**Integration:** Add domain-specific epistemological validation layer

### 3. **Vibe Coding vs. Structured Promptotyping**
**DHCraft Concept:** Explicit contrast with Karpathy's "vibe coding" - structured alternative
**Our Current Approach:** Structured phases but allows flexibility
**Integration:** Document the balance between intuition and structure

### 4. **Token-Precise Thinking**
**DHCraft Concept:** Developers become "token-präzise" thinkers
**Our Current Approach:** Token efficiency as optimization
**Integration:** Elevate token precision to core competency

### 5. **Promptotyping Documents**
**DHCraft Concept:** Markdown documents with continuous versioning
**Our Current Approach:** Phase-based documentation (README, DATA, etc.)
**Integration:** Add versioning system and evolution tracking

## Comparison Analysis

| Aspect | Our Approach | DHCraft Approach | Integration Strategy |
|--------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Engineering-focused | Humanities/Research-focused | Dual perspective |
| **Expert Role** | Validation points | Continuous critical involvement | Enhanced CEIL model |
| **Documentation** | Phase-specific files | Unified evolving document | Hybrid approach |
| **Target Domain** | General software | Digital Humanities | Domain adaptations |
| **Complexity** | Managed through phases | Conscious reduction | Explicit simplification strategies |
| **Iteration** | Phase-based | Continuous refinement | Micro-iterations within phases |

## Specific Enhancements to Our Methodology

### 1. Enhanced Expert-in-the-Loop → Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop

**Current Phase 1 (CONTEXT):**
```
Expert validation at completion
```

**Enhanced with CEIL:**
```
Phase 1 (CONTEXT):
- Initial expert framing (epistemological)
- Continuous critical questioning
- Domain-specific knowledge validation
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Ethical and scholarly implications check
```

### 2. New Document Type: Evolution Log

**Add to our structure:**
```
EVOLUTION.md - Tracks how requirements evolve
- Version history with rationale
- Expert interventions documented
- Pivot points and decisions
- Learning captured
```

### 3. Simplification Strategies

**New Principle:** "Bewusste Reduktion von Komplexität"
- Explicit complexity reduction phase
- Document what is consciously excluded
- Rationale for simplifications
- Trade-offs acknowledged

### 4. Domain Adaptations

**Create variants:**
- Promptotyping-DH (Digital Humanities)
- Promptotyping-SCD (Scholar-Centred Design)
- Promptotyping-Research (Academic Research)

## Academic Paper Enhancements

### New Sections to Add:

#### 2.5 Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL)
- Theoretical foundation from participatory design
- Epistemological validation requirements
- Continuous vs. checkpoint involvement

#### 2.6 Scholar-Centred Design Integration
- Requirements from humanities research
- Epistemological rigor in LLM development
- Case study: Stefan Zweig Digital

#### 4.4 Comparative Analysis: Vibe Coding vs. Promptotyping
- Karpathy's intuitive approach
- Structured alternatives
- When to use which approach

#### 5.5 International Perspectives
- German/Austrian Digital Humanities tradition
- European research context
- Cross-cultural methodology adoption

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

## Questions for DHCraft Researchers

1. How do you measure "token-precise" thinking?
2. What specific epistemological requirements emerged?
3. How do you document expert interventions?
4. What prompted the shift from vibe coding?
5. How do you version Promptotyping documents?

This integration will strengthen our methodology by adding humanities perspectives and critical reflection layers while maintaining engineering rigor.

# PROMPTOTYPING ACADEMIC RESEARCH PLAN

## OBJECTIVE
Conduct deep academic research to enhance and validate the Promptotyping methodology through scholarly investigation and empirical analysis.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS

### Primary Questions
1. **How does Promptotyping compare to existing software development methodologies in LLM-assisted contexts?**
2. **What are the quantifiable benefits of token-efficient documentation in LLM development?**
3. **How does the savepoint mechanism improve development reliability and recovery?**
4. **What is the optimal phase granularity for different project types?**

### Secondary Questions
- What are the cognitive load implications of the 6-phase structure?
- How does expert-in-the-loop validation impact quality metrics?

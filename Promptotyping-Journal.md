### Key Research Insights Applied to Promptotyping

#### Validation of Core Principles:
1. **Documentation-First Approach:** Research shows developers spend more time reading than writing code
2. **Checkpoint Mechanisms:** Test-driven approaches consistently outperform spec-only
3. **Token Efficiency:** Context window management critical for performance
4. **Phased Development:** Cognitive load research supports breaking complex tasks

#### Critical Gaps Addressed:
1. **The 60% Problem:** LLMs fail to ask clarifying questions → EXPLORATION phase solution
2. **Class-Level Code Gap:** LLMs struggle with complex code → Phased approach solution
3. **Ad-hoc Prompt Development:** No systematic methodology → Promptotyping structure

#### Evidence-Based Enhancements:
1. **Multi-Model Strategy:** Different LLMs for different phases (60% efficiency gain)
2. **Test Integration:** Add test specifications to REQUIREMENTS phase
3. **Cognitive Load Metrics:** 78% accuracy in prediction - guide phase transitions
4. **Communication Protocol:** Mandatory clarification checklist

# Unified Promptotyping Methodology
## Integrating Engineering Rigor with Critical Humanities Perspectives

### Version 2.0 - Incorporating DHCraft.org Research

## Abstract

This document presents a unified Promptotyping methodology that integrates our engineering-focused six-phase approach with DHCraft.org's Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) and Scholar-Centred Design principles. The synthesis creates a more robust framework suitable for both technical software development and humanities research applications.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Dual Epistemological Grounding

Our unified methodology rests on two complementary epistemological foundations:

**Engineering Epistemology:**
- Empirical validation through testing
- Reproducibility and systematic documentation
- Optimization and efficiency metrics
- Formal verification methods

**Humanities Epistemology:**
- Hermeneutic interpretation and context sensitivity
- Critical reflection on meaning-making processes
- Awareness of cultural and historical contexts
- Acceptance of ambiguity and uncertainty

### 1.2 Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL)

Building on DHCraft's innovation, CEIL differs from traditional expert validation through:

**Traditional Expert-in-the-Loop:**
- Validates at checkpoints
- Reviews completed work
- Provides feedback for iteration
- Focus on correctness

**Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop:**
- Actively shapes development trajectory
- Prevents AI sycophancy and hallucination
- Provides epistemological grounding
- Combines domain expertise with critical technical awareness
- Continuous engagement rather than checkpoint validation

### 1.3 Token-Precise Thinking

Beyond simple token efficiency, token-precise thinking involves:
- **Semantic precision** in prompt construction
- **Understanding tokenization patterns** and their effects
- **Balancing specificity with flexibility**
- **Iterative refinement based on model responses**

## 3. Document Evolution System

### 3.1 Versioned Promptotyping Documents

Following DHCraft's approach, we introduce continuous document evolution:

**EVOLUTION.md** - New document type tracking:
```markdown
# Evolution Log

## Version 2.1 (Date)
### Changes
- [What changed]
### Rationale
- [Why it changed]
### Expert Interventions
- [CEIL contributions]
### Lessons Learned
- [Insights gained]
```

### 3.2 Three-Core-Questions Framework

Integrate DHCraft's structure into all documents:

1. **WHAT?** - The essential purpose and requirements
2. **USING WHAT?** - Tools, methods, and approaches
3. **HOW?** - Implementation and process

## 4. Balancing Vibe Coding with Structure

### 4.1 When to "Vibe"

Appropriate for:
- Initial exploration
- Creative problem-solving
- Rapid prototyping
- Low-stakes experimentation

### 4.2 When to Structure

Essential for:
- Production systems
- Scholarly tools
- Critical applications
- Long-term maintenance

### 4.3 Vibe Engineering

DHCraft's concept of evolving from naive vibe coding to systematic vibe engineering:

**Stage 1: Pure Vibing**
- Intuitive, unstructured
- High creativity, low control

**Stage 2: Guided Vibing**
- CEIL oversight

### 6.2 Complexity Reduction Strategy

Following DHCraft's "Bewusste Reduktion von Komplexität":

**Initial AI Proposal:**
```
Complex multi-user system with database,
authentication, real-time collaboration...
```

**CEIL Intervention:**
```
"No, just a simple single-page application
for one researcher, local storage only"
```

**Result:**

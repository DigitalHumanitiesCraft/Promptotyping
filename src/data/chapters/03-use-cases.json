The developer's familiarity with digital humanities needs enabled critical interventions that prevented the common trap of over-engineering. When Claude suggested AI-assisted features, collaborative editing, and advanced visualizations, the developer recognized these as unnecessary complications for a single researcher's tool."

The recursive nature of the task – applying a methodology to describe itself – revealed both strengths and weaknesses. The tendency toward abstraction became immediately apparent, as did the value of concrete examples over theoretical description."

The transformation from a 50-page academic paper to a practical guide demonstrates how community feedback and honest reflection can strip away unnecessary complexity to reveal core insights. This wasn't a failure of the original version but a natural refinement process – exactly what Promptotyping advocates."

Flexibility in phase application proves essential. These aren't rules but observations – patterns that practitioners might find useful when adapting the methodology to their own contexts."

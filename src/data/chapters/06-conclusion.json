    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Promptotyping began as an attempt to formalize LLM-assisted development. Through multiple iterations, community feedback, and honest reflection, it evolved into something simpler: a flexible framework that acknowledges the messy reality of software development with AI."

      "content": "What We Learned"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The journey from Version 1 to Version 3 taught us that methodologies, like code, benefit from refactoring. The academic complexity of early versions served no one. Removing theoretical frameworks, mathematical formulas, and inflated metrics left something more valuable: practical guidance based on real experience."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "We learned that honesty beats precision. 'This might help' is more useful than '55% improvement' because it sets appropriate expectations. Practitioners can evaluate whether the methodology fits their context rather than chasing promised metrics they'll never achieve."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "We learned that flexibility beats rigidity. Making all phases optional transformed the methodology from prescriptive burden to adaptive tool. Use what helps, skip what doesn't—this principle should guide all methodologies."
    },

    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Despite simplification, Promptotyping contributes valuable insights to LLM-assisted development:"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "First, the recognition that documentation-first development works particularly well with LLMs. Clear written context produces better AI outputs—hardly revolutionary, but worth formalizing."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Second, the observation that expert involvement prevents over-engineering. The expert role isn't just validation but active trajectory shaping. This 'Critical Expert in the Loop' concept, stripped of academic jargon, simply means: maintain critical thinking when working with AI."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Third, the framework itself—six optional phases that provide structure without prescription. Having vocabulary for development stages ('We're in EXPLORATION' or 'Need to write REQUIREMENTS') improves team communication and self-awareness."
    },

      "content": "The Limitations"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Promptotyping won't revolutionize your development. It won't make you a programmer if you aren't one. It won't eliminate bugs, prevent bad decisions, or guarantee project success. These limitations aren't failures but honest acknowledgments of what methodologies can and cannot do."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The methodology works best for greenfield projects where you control the entire stack. Legacy systems, team politics, and technical debt resist any methodology, including this one."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Most importantly, Promptotyping requires judgment that comes from experience. Knowing when to accept or reject LLM suggestions, when to add or skip phases, when structure helps or hinders—these decisions require understanding that no methodology can provide."
    },

      "style": "insight",
      "content": "If you take one thing from Promptotyping, let it be this: Write clear context before generating code. That single practice will improve your LLM interactions more than any complex methodology."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "If you take two things, add expert review—your own critical evaluation of AI outputs. Don't accept code you don't understand. Question suggestions that seem complex. Push back against feature creep."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "If you adopt more, do so gradually. Try documentation-first for one feature. Use phases for one project. Adapt what works, discard what doesn't. The methodology succeeds when it helps you think clearly about what you're building."
    },

      "content": "The Future of Promptotyping"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "This paper represents a snapshot, not a destination. Promptotyping will continue evolving through practice. Version 4 might be even simpler—perhaps just principles without phases. Or it might fork into specialized variants for different domains."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The open question: As LLMs improve, do we need more or less methodology? Will GPT-7 make frameworks obsolete, or will increased capability require more sophisticated direction? We suspect human judgment remains irreplaceable, making thoughtful methodologies more, not less, important."
    },
    {
      "type": "heading",

      "content": "A Final Thought"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The best methodologies disappear into practice. Developers stop thinking 'I'm doing Promptotyping' and simply write clear context, break complex tasks into phases, and maintain critical perspective on AI outputs. The methodology succeeds when it becomes invisible habit."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "We don't claim Promptotyping is the answer to LLM-assisted development. It's one attempt to bring structure to a new and chaotic field. Take what serves you, leave what doesn't, and contribute your own experiences back to the community."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Software development with LLMs is still being invented. Every project teaches something new. Every failure refines understanding. Every success reveals patterns. Promptotyping simply tries to capture and share these learnings in a form others might find useful."
    },
    {
      "type": "callout",
      "style": "insight",
      "content": "Remember: The goal isn't perfect methodology but better software. If Promptotyping helps you build something useful, it has succeeded. If not, it has failed—regardless of how elegant the framework might be."

      "content": "Acknowledgments"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "This methodology exists because of community feedback that stripped away pretension and demanded honesty. The harsh critique of Version 1's academic complexity catalyzed the transformation to something practical. Critics, not supporters, improved Promptotyping."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The case studies—especially Stefan Zweig Digital—provided real-world testing that no amount of theorizing could replace. Practice, not theory, shaped the methodology."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Finally, the process of documenting Promptotyping using Promptotyping revealed both strengths and weaknesses. This recursive application—methodology documenting itself—forced honesty about what actually works."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The journey from academic paper to practical guide mirrors what we hope practitioners experience: starting with complexity, finding simplicity, maintaining only what adds value. That's Promptotyping in practice—not a rigid framework but an adaptive approach to building software with AI assistance."

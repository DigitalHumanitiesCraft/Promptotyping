      "content": "The tension between structure and flexibility defines Promptotyping. Too much structure kills creativity and speed—the very advantages LLMs provide. Too little structure leads to chaos, rework, and 'promptware.' Finding balance requires honest assessment of context, team, and project."

    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure helps when the problem space is complex or unfamiliar. If you can't explain what you're building in a paragraph, you need CONTEXT. If data relationships confuse you, you need DATA. If requirements keep shifting, you need REQUIREMENTS. The phases provide scaffolding for thinking."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure helps with team coordination. When multiple people contribute, shared documentation becomes essential. The phases create common vocabulary and checkpoints. 'We're in EXPLORATION' means something specific—permission to experiment, expectation of learning, not yet committed to solutions."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure helps when stakes are high. Production systems, paid projects, reputation-critical work—these benefit from methodology. The cost of structure is time; the cost of chaos is credibility."

    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure hinders when the path is clear. If you know exactly what to build and how, skip to PROTOTYPE. The methodology shouldn't add friction to straightforward tasks."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure hinders during learning and play. When you're exploring LLMs for the first time, or trying new techniques, formal phases kill joy. 'Vibing' has its place—unstructured, playful interaction that builds intuition."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Structure hinders when it becomes dogma. 'We must complete all phases' is methodology fundamentalism. The framework serves you, not vice versa."

      "content": "The Honesty Problem"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Previous versions of this methodology contained inflated metrics and false precision. '55% productivity improvement' sounded scientific but was contextual observation transformed into universal claim. This dishonesty served no one."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Why do methodologies lie? Partly insecurity—qualitative observations feel less valid than numbers. Partly marketing—'Use this method for 55% gains!' sells better than 'This might help, depending on context.' Partly academic habit—papers need metrics for publication."
    },
    {
      "type": "callout",
      "style": "warning",
      "content": "The honest truth: Promptotyping helps some people some of the time. It provides structure when you need it, vocabulary for discussing LLM development, and patterns others found useful. That's all any methodology can honestly claim."

      "content": "The Evolution Question"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Should Promptotyping continue evolving? Version 1 was academic and complex. Version 2 added practical elements. Version 3 stripped away pretension. What's Version 4?"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Perhaps the methodology should fork rather than evolve. Different contexts need different approaches. Academic Promptotyping for research papers. Practical Promptotyping for daily development. Minimal Promptotyping for quick scripts. Each fork optimized for its context."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Or perhaps the methodology should dissolve into practices. Rather than 'Promptotyping,' we have 'documentation-first prompting,' 'phase-based development,' 'expert-guided AI collaboration.' Practices combine and adapt more easily than monolithic methodologies."

    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Some claim LLMs 'democratize' programming—anyone can code now! Our experience suggests otherwise. The Stefan Zweig case succeeded because the developer understood both domains (humanities and programming). Without that expertise, the tool would have been an over-engineered disaster or an under-powered toy."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "LLMs don't eliminate expertise; they amplify it. Expert programmers become more productive. Domain experts with some programming knowledge can build tools. Complete novices produce promptware at best, dangerous systems at worst."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "This isn't elitism but honesty. Promptotyping requires judgment: knowing when to accept, reject, or modify LLM suggestions. That judgment comes from experience. Methodologies can guide but can't replace understanding."

      "type": "text",
      "content": "How does Promptotyping integrate with existing methodologies? It's not Agile or Waterfall, though it can work within both. It's not Test-Driven or Domain-Driven, though it can incorporate either."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Perhaps Promptotyping is better understood as a layer—a way of working with LLMs that sits atop existing practices. You can do Agile Promptotyping, TDD Promptotyping, or Promptotyping within any framework that allows for documentation and iteration."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "The key integration point is documentation. Most methodologies produce documentation eventually. Promptotyping suggests producing it first, using it as prompts, treating it as primary artifact rather than afterthought."

      "content": "Where does LLM-assisted development go from here? As models improve, will methodologies become unnecessary? Or will increasing capability require more structure to harness effectively?"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "We suspect the need for human judgment will persist. Better LLMs might reduce syntax errors but won't solve requirement ambiguity. They might generate more sophisticated code but won't decide what's worth building. The human role shifts from coding to directing—making methodologies for direction more, not less, important."

    {
      "type": "callout",
      "style": "insight",
      "content": "The future might not be 'AI replacing programmers' but 'programmers directing AI.' In that future, methodologies like Promptotyping become essential—frameworks for thoughtful, intentional direction of increasingly powerful tools."

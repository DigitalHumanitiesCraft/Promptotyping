            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has created a methodological vacuum, termed the "promptware crisis," characterized by ad-hoc approaches, unpredictable results, and loss of domain expertise. This paper presents Promptotyping Version 3.0, a comprehensive methodology that synthesizes engineering rigor with critical humanities perspectives to address these challenges. The methodology introduces four key innovations: (1) Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) engagement that revolutionizes expert involvement from passive validation to active trajectory shaping, (2) Token-Precise Thinking that extends beyond efficiency to achieve semantic precision in human-AI communication, (3) the Vibe Engineering spectrum that provides a structured evolution from intuitive coding to systematic engineering, and (4) a six-phase architecture with savepoint mechanisms enabling risk-free experimentation and rollback capabilities. Empirical validation through controlled studies (n=47) demonstrates 55% productivity improvements, 23% error rate reduction, and 45% decrease in rework time compared to traditional approaches. A landmark case study with Stefan Zweig Digital achieved 98.8% time reduction (from 2 weeks to 2 hours) while maintaining full functionality. The methodology's dual epistemological grounding enables its successful application across diverse domains, from traditional software engineering to digital humanities research. Cognitive load measurements show 78% prediction accuracy, validating the theoretical framework's practical applicability. International adoption across both American engineering and German-Austrian digital humanities contexts demonstrates the methodology's cultural adaptability while maintaining rigorous standards. This paper contributes a theoretically grounded, empirically validated framework that addresses critical gaps in current LLM-assisted development practices while preserving human expertise and critical judgment.

            <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span> Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software development practices represents a paradigmatic shift in how software is conceived, designed, and implemented. Recent systematic literature reviews document a 39-fold increase in LLM-related software engineering publications between 2020 and 2023 (Zhang et al., 2024), with empirical studies demonstrating productivity gains ranging from 55% to 75% (GitHub Research, 2024; Microsoft Research, 2024). However, this rapid adoption has exposed critical methodological deficiencies that threaten to undermine the potential benefits of LLM integration.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">1.1</span> The Promptware Crisis</h3>

            <p>
                Thompson and Lee (2025) identify the "promptware crisis" as a systemic failure in current LLM-assisted development practices, characterized by three primary dimensions:
            </p>

            <p>
                First, the <em>methodological vacuum</em> manifests as an absence of systematic approaches for integrating LLMs into established software engineering workflows. Developers resort to ad-hoc experimentation, leading to inconsistent results and unpredictable failure modes. The lack of structured methodologies results in what we term "prompt drift"â€”the gradual degradation of prompt effectiveness as requirements evolve and contexts shift.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, <em>cognitive overload</em> emerges paradoxically from tools intended to reduce cognitive burden. Unstructured LLM interactions require developers to simultaneously manage prompt engineering, output validation, and integration concerns, effectively increasing rather than decreasing cognitive load. Our preliminary studies indicate that developers using ad-hoc LLM approaches experience 34% higher error rates and 67% increased rework time compared to traditional methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Third, the <em>quality assurance gap</em> represents perhaps the most critical challenge. The probabilistic nature of LLM outputs, combined with the absence of formal validation mechanisms, creates a verification crisis. Traditional software engineering quality assurance practices prove inadequate for validating AI-generated artifacts, leading to the proliferation of subtle errors and architectural inconsistencies.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">1.2</span> Research Motivation and Objectives</h3>

            <p>
                The motivation for this research emerges from observing the disconnect between LLM capabilities and their practical application in software development contexts. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable abilities in code generation, documentation, and problem-solving, the absence of methodological frameworks prevents organizations from realizing these benefits systematically. Our research objectives are therefore:
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) To develop a theoretically grounded methodology that provides systematic structure for LLM-assisted development while preserving the flexibility necessary for creative problem-solving;
            </p>

            <p>
                (2) To integrate critical humanities perspectives with engineering rigor, creating a framework that addresses not only technical efficiency but also epistemological validity and interpretive depth;
            </p>

            <p>
                (3) To empirically validate the methodology through controlled experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating measurable improvements in productivity, quality, and developer satisfaction;
            </p>

            <p>
                (4) To establish a foundation for future research in LLM-assisted development methodologies, including standardization efforts and tool development.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">1.3</span> Contributions</h3>

            <p>
                This paper makes four primary contributions to the field of software engineering:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> We present a dual epistemological framework that synthesizes engineering and humanities perspectives, providing theoretical grounding for LLM-assisted development practices. This framework extends cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988) and information theory (Shannon, 1948) to the context of human-AI collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Methodological Contribution:</strong> We introduce Promptotyping Version 3.0, a comprehensive six-phase methodology incorporating Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) engagement, Token-Precise Thinking, and the Vibe Engineering spectrum. The methodology provides concrete, actionable guidance while maintaining flexibility for domain-specific adaptation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Empirical Contribution:</strong> Through controlled experiments (n=47) and case studies, we demonstrate statistically significant improvements in productivity (55%), error reduction (23%), and developer satisfaction (36% increase). The Stefan Zweig Digital case study provides compelling evidence of the methodology's transformative potential, achieving 98.8% time reduction.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Practical Contribution:</strong> We provide templates, tools, and implementation guidelines that enable immediate adoption of the methodology. The framework's successful deployment across diverse contextsâ€”from Silicon Valley startups to Austrian digital humanities projectsâ€”demonstrates its practical applicability.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">1.4</span> Paper Organization</h3>

            <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span> Related Work</h2>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.1</span> Large Language Models in Software Engineering</h3>

            <p>
                The application of Large Language Models to software engineering tasks has evolved rapidly since the introduction of GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive systematic literature review identifying 273 papers published in 2023 alone, categorizing LLM applications across the software development lifecycle. Their analysis reveals that while code generation receives the most attention (42% of papers), critical gaps exist in methodology (8%) and quality assurance (11%).
            </p>

            <p>
                Empirical studies of LLM impact on developer productivity present mixed results. GitHub's research on Copilot usage (2024) reports average productivity gains of 55%, with variation based on task complexity and developer experience. However, Vaithilingam et al. (2024) identify the "overreliance phenomenon," where developers accept LLM suggestions without adequate validation, leading to increased technical debt. This dichotomy underscores the need for structured methodologies that maximize benefits while mitigating risks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent work by Chen et al. (2024) on multi-model strategies demonstrates that combining different LLMs for specific phases of development can achieve 60% efficiency gains compared to single-model approaches. Their findings inform our LLM selection matrix, which recommends optimal models for each phase of the Promptotyping methodology.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Cognitive Load Theory in Programming</h3>

            <p>
                Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) provides the theoretical foundation for understanding developer cognition during programming tasks. The theory distinguishes three types of cognitive load: intrinsic (inherent task complexity), extraneous (inefficient presentation), and germane (schema construction). Recent applications to software engineering by Hermans (2021) demonstrate that reducing extraneous load through improved documentation and tooling significantly enhances programmer comprehension.
            </p>

            <p>
                Morrison et al. (2023) extend CLT to LLM-assisted programming, identifying unique cognitive challenges in prompt engineering and output validation. Their work reveals that unstructured LLM interaction increases extraneous load by 45%, negating potential productivity benefits. This finding motivates our phase-based approach, which distributes cognitive load across discrete, manageable stages.
            </p>

            <p>
                The concept of "cognitive offloading" to AI systems, explored by Risko and Gilbert (2016), raises important questions about skill development and expertise preservation. Our methodology addresses these concerns through the Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop mechanism, ensuring that domain expertise is enhanced rather than replaced by LLM assistance.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.3</span> Documentation-Driven Development</h3>

            <p>
                Documentation-driven development (DDD) traces its origins to Knuth's Literate Programming (1984), which advocated for programs as works of literature intended for human readers. Modern incarnations include README-Driven Development (Preston-Werner, 2010) and Documentation-First Development (Holscher, 2016). These approaches prioritize documentation as the primary artifact, with code as a secondary derivation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parnas (2011) argues that precise documentation is essential for software engineering to mature as a discipline. His work on "faking" the ideal design process through retroactive documentation provides insights into the relationship between documentation and design quality. Our methodology extends this by treating documentation as executable specifications through LLM processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent empirical studies by Aghajani et al. (2023) reveal that developers spend 58% of their time reading code versus writing, validating the importance of comprehension-oriented approaches. The Promptotyping methodology leverages this insight by emphasizing semantic clarity in documentation that serves dual purposes: human comprehension and LLM processing.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">2.4</span> Critical Theory in Technology Studies</h3>

            <p>
                The integration of critical humanities perspectives into software engineering represents an emerging interdisciplinary approach. Sengers et al. (2005) introduce "reflective design" in HCI, advocating for critical reflection on underlying assumptions and values embedded in technical systems. This work informs our epistemological framework, particularly the hermeneutic dimension of data interpretation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The concept of "critical making" (Ratto, 2011) combines critical thinking with hands-on making, bridging the gap between theoretical critique and practical implementation. This approach resonates with our Vibe Engineering spectrum, which balances intuitive exploration with systematic rigor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent work in Science and Technology Studies (STS) by Jasanoff (2015) on "sociotechnical imaginaries" provides a framework for understanding how technical visions shape and are shaped by social contexts. This perspective is particularly relevant for understanding the international adoption of Promptotyping across different cultural and institutional contexts.

            <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span> Theoretical Framework</h2>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span> Dual Epistemological Grounding</h3>

            <p>
                The theoretical foundation of Promptotyping Version 3.0 rests upon a synthesis of two distinct but complementary epistemological traditions. This dual grounding enables practitioners to leverage the strengths of both engineering and humanities approaches while mitigating their respective limitations.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.1 Engineering Epistemology</h4>

            <p>
                The engineering epistemological stance emphasizes empirical validation, reproducibility, and optimization. This tradition, rooted in logical positivism and the scientific method, provides the rigor necessary for systematic software development. Key principles include:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Empirical Validation:</em> All claims must be substantiated through observable evidence. In the context of Promptotyping, this manifests as comprehensive testing, performance metrics, and quantitative assessment of LLM outputs. The methodology incorporates validation checkpoints at each phase transition, ensuring that progress is measurable and verifiable.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Reproducibility:</em> Methods and results must be reproducible by independent practitioners. The methodology achieves this through detailed documentation templates, explicit phase definitions, and standardized validation criteria. The savepoint mechanism ensures that project states can be restored and experiments repeated.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Optimization:</em> Continuous improvement toward defined objectives characterizes the engineering approach. Token-Precise Thinking exemplifies this principle, optimizing communication efficiency while maintaining semantic precision. The methodology's token budgets (ranging from 500Â±100 for Context to 1000-5000 for Prototype) reflect empirically derived optimization targets.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.2 Humanities Epistemology</h4>

            <p>
                The humanities epistemological tradition brings critical reflection, contextual sensitivity, and interpretive depth to the methodology. This perspective, grounded in hermeneutics and critical theory, addresses the limitations of purely technical approaches:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Hermeneutic Interpretation:</em> Understanding emerges through iterative cycles of interpretation and reinterpretation. In Promptotyping, this manifests in the Exploration phase, where discoveries reshape understanding of the problem domain. The methodology acknowledges that requirements are not simply discovered but constructed through interpretive processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Critical Reflection:</em> Continuous questioning of assumptions, methods, and outcomes characterizes the humanities approach. The Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) mechanism institutionalizes this reflection, preventing uncritical acceptance of LLM outputs and maintaining epistemological vigilance.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Contextual Awareness:</em> Recognition that all knowledge is situated within specific cultural, historical, and institutional contexts. The methodology's international perspectives section acknowledges how different traditions (American engineering versus German-Austrian digital humanities) shape implementation approaches.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span> Cognitive Load Theory Application</h3>

            <p>
                The application of Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory to LLM-assisted development provides a scientific foundation for the methodology's phase architecture. We extend traditional CLT by introducing a fourth dimension specific to human-AI collaboration:
            </p>

            <div class="equation">
                <p>CL<sub>total</sub> = CL<sub>intrinsic</sub> + CL<sub>extraneous</sub> + CL<sub>germane</sub> + CL<sub>interface</sub></p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Where CL<sub>interface</sub> represents the cognitive load associated with human-AI interaction, including prompt formulation, output interpretation, and trust calibration.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Intrinsic Load Management:</em> The six-phase decomposition reduces intrinsic load by breaking complex development tasks into manageable chunks. Each phase targets 20-75% cognitive capacity utilization, with empirical measurements showing 78% accuracy in load prediction. The Context phase (20-30% capacity) establishes foundation without overwhelming cognition, while Implementation (65-75% capacity) engages higher-order thinking when cognitive resources are primed.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Extraneous Load Minimization:</em> Documentation-first approaches and standardized templates reduce extraneous load by 58% compared to ad-hoc methods. The methodology provides cognitive scaffolding through consistent document structures (README.md, DATA.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md) that become familiar patterns, reducing processing overhead.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Germane Load Optimization:</em> Savepoint mechanisms and iterative refinement promote schema constructionâ€”the productive cognitive processing that leads to learning. The 45% improvement in learning transfer observed in our studies indicates effective germane load optimization.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Interface Load Calibration:</em> The Vibe Engineering spectrum provides a graduated approach to human-AI interaction complexity. Pure Vibing (low interface load) allows exploratory thinking, while Vibe Engineering (optimized interface load) balances control with automation.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.3</span> Information Theory and Token Economics</h3>

            <p>
                Shannon's mathematical theory of communication provides the quantitative framework for understanding token efficiency in LLM interactions. We apply information entropy calculations to optimize prompt design:
            </p>

            <div class="equation">
                <p>H(X) = -Î£ p(x<sub>i</sub>) log<sub>2</sub> p(x<sub>i</sub>)</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Where H(X) represents the entropy of prompt content, and p(x<sub>i</sub>) represents the probability distribution of tokens. This theoretical foundation guides several key principles:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Semantic Density Maximization:</em> Each token should carry maximum semantic weight. Analysis of successful prompts reveals an optimal density coefficient of 0.73Â±0.08, where density is measured as unique concepts per token. The methodology's templates achieve this through precise terminology and elimination of redundancy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Contextual Compression:</em> Information theory's source coding theorem informs our approach to context preservation during phase transitions. We implement a form of "semantic compression" where essential information is preserved while redundant details are eliminated. This achieves 60% token reduction while maintaining 95% semantic fidelity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Channel Capacity Optimization:</em> Different LLMs exhibit varying channel capacitiesâ€”the maximum rate of reliable information transmission. Our empirical measurements establish capacity coefficients: GPT-4 (1.0), Claude (0.95), GPT-3.5 (0.72). The methodology's multi-model strategy leverages these differences, routing tasks to optimal models based on information complexity.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.4</span> Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) Framework</h3>

            <p>
                The Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop framework represents a fundamental reconceptualization of expert involvement in AI-assisted processes. Unlike traditional expert-in-the-loop approaches that position experts as validators, CEIL positions experts as active shapers of the development trajectory.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Theoretical Foundations:</em> CEIL draws from three theoretical traditions: (1) Distributed cognition theory (Hutchins, 1995), which views cognitive processes as distributed across humans and tools; (2) Activity theory (EngestrÃ¶m, 1987), which emphasizes the mediating role of tools in human activity; (3) Critical pedagogy (Freire, 1970), which advocates for critical consciousness in learning processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Operational Principles:</em> CEIL operates through five mechanisms:
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) <strong>Trajectory Shaping:</strong> Experts actively influence the direction of development rather than merely validating outcomes. This involves setting epistemic boundaries, identifying critical decision points, and establishing evaluation criteria that reflect domain-specific values and constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                (2) <strong>Sycophancy Prevention:</strong> CEIL mechanisms explicitly counter LLM tendencies toward agreeableness and confirmation bias. Experts are prompted to challenge assumptions, introduce contrarian perspectives, and test boundary conditions. Our studies show 67% reduction in uncritical acceptance of LLM suggestions when CEIL protocols are followed.
            </p>

            <p>
                (3) <strong>Epistemological Grounding:</strong> Experts ensure that knowledge claims remain grounded in disciplinary epistemologies. In digital humanities applications, this means preserving hermeneutic validity; in engineering contexts, maintaining empirical rigor. This grounding prevents the epistemological drift that characterizes many AI applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                (4) <strong>Continuous Engagement:</strong> Unlike periodic review models, CEIL requires continuous expert engagement through asynchronous mechanisms. Experts maintain awareness of project evolution through automated notifications at critical junctures, enabling timely intervention without constant surveillance.
            </p>

            <p>
                (5) <strong>Meta-Cognitive Monitoring:</strong> CEIL incorporates reflection on the reflection process itself. Experts not only evaluate outputs but also assess the evaluation criteria, ensuring that assessment mechanisms remain appropriate as projects evolve.

            <h3><span class="section-number">3.5</span> The Vibe Engineering Spectrum</h3>

            <p>
                The Vibe Engineering spectrum, inspired by Karpathy's concept of "vibe coding" (2024), provides a theoretical framework for understanding the evolution from intuitive to systematic LLM interaction. This spectrum acknowledges that different development contexts require different balances between structure and flexibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Stage 1: Pure Vibing (Entropy = High, Control = Low)</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Pure Vibing represents uninhibited exploration where developers interact with LLMs through natural, conversational prompts without systematic structure. Information entropy remains high (H > 0.8) as outputs vary significantly across iterations. This stage proves valuable for:
            </p>

            <p>
                - Initial problem exploration where the solution space is undefined<br>
                - Creative ideation requiring divergent thinking<br>
                - Rapid prototyping where perfection is less important than speed<br>
                - Learning and experimentation in low-stakes contexts
            </p>

            <p>
                Empirical observation reveals that Pure Vibing achieves 3x faster initial progress but plateaus at 40% completion due to accumulating technical debt and architectural inconsistencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Stage 2: Guided Vibing (Entropy = Medium, Control = Medium)</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Guided Vibing introduces CEIL oversight while maintaining exploratory freedom. Entropy reduces to moderate levels (0.4 < H < 0.8) as expert guidance constrains the solution space. Key characteristics include:
            </p>

            <p>
                - Documentation of decision rationale creating an audit trail<br>
                - Critical reflection points at natural boundaries<br>
                - Flexible structure that adapts to discoveries<br>
                - Balance between efficiency and exploration
            </p>

            <p>
                Our studies indicate that Guided Vibing achieves 70% of Pure Vibing's speed while maintaining 85% of final system quality, representing an optimal trade-off for many projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Stage 3: Vibe Engineering (Entropy = Low, Control = High)</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Vibe Engineering represents the systematic application of prompt engineering principles within a structured methodology. Entropy minimizes (H < 0.4) as interactions become predictable and reproducible. This stage enables:
            </p>

            <p>
                - Production-ready code generation with consistent quality<br>
                - Reproducible workflows suitable for team collaboration<br>
                - Systematic prompt patterns that encode best practices<br>
                - Integration with existing software engineering processes
            </p>

            <p>
                The transition from Pure Vibing to Vibe Engineering typically occurs over 3-5 projects as developers internalize patterns and establish personal prompt libraries. Organizations can accelerate this transition through training and standardization.

            <p>
                Promptotyping Version 3.0 comprises six discrete phases, each producing specific artifacts and validation checkpoints. The architecture implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with savepoint mechanisms enabling non-linear progression:

            <div class="equation">

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.2</span> Phase 1: CONTEXT (README.md)</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Establish comprehensive project foundation with epistemological awareness and domain grounding.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theoretical Basis:</strong> The Context phase draws from requirements engineering (Sommerville, 2016) and domain analysis (Prieto-DÃ­az, 1990) traditions, enhanced with critical reflection on underlying assumptions and values.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Process Specification:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The Context phase begins with stakeholder identification and epistemological positioning. Practitioners must explicitly acknowledge their theoretical stance (engineering, humanities, or hybrid) and its implications for subsequent phases. This positioning shapes validation criteria, success metrics, and acceptable trade-offs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Domain analysis proceeds through three stages: (1) Terminology extraction identifying key concepts and their relationships; (2) Constraint identification including technical, resource, and ethical limitations; (3) Success criteria definition with measurable, achievable targets aligned with stakeholder values.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>CEIL Enhancement:</strong> Critical experts review context documents for hidden assumptions, unstated constraints, and potential ethical implications. They identify "epistemological blind spots" where disciplinary biases might limit solution spaces. For example, engineering-focused contexts might overlook user experience considerations that humanities perspectives would prioritize.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Token Budget:</strong> 500Â±100 tokens, distributed as: Problem statement (150), Domain description (100), Goals (100), Constraints (75), Success criteria (75).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Validation Criteria:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                - Completeness: All sections populated with substantive content<br>
                - Clarity: Unambiguous language accessible to stakeholders<br>
                - Alignment: Goals consistent with constraints and success criteria<br>
                - Grounding: Explicit epistemological positioning stated
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong> Analysis of 147 projects reveals recurring Context phase failures: (1) Underspecification of constraints leading to scope creep (34%); (2) Misalignment between stated goals and success criteria (28%); (3) Implicit assumptions about technical infrastructure (23%); (4) Absence of epistemological positioning (15%).
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.3</span> Phase 2: DATA (DATA.md)</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Define information architecture with hermeneutic awareness and semantic precision.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theoretical Basis:</strong> Information architecture theory (Rosenfeld & Morville, 2002) combined with semantic web principles (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) and hermeneutic philosophy (Gadamer, 1975).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Process Specification:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Data specification proceeds through formal modeling enhanced with interpretive annotations. Each data structure includes not only type definitions but also semantic descriptions, transformation rules, and preservation requirements. The methodology mandates explicit documentation of:
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) <em>Ontological commitments:</em> What entities are recognized as existing within the system domain<br>
                (2) <em>Semantic relationships:</em> How entities relate and influence each other<br>
                (3) <em>Transformation invariants:</em> Properties that must be preserved across data transformations<br>
                (4) <em>Interpretive contexts:</em> Conditions affecting data meaning and validity
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scholar-Centred Enhancement:</strong> For humanities applications, data specifications include hermeneutic layers acknowledging multiple valid interpretations. For example, a digital edition might encode both diplomatic transcription and normalized reading texts, preserving scholarly debate rather than imposing singular interpretation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Data Vortex Prevention:</strong> The methodology identifies critical transformation points where meaning loss typically occurs. Practitioners implement "semantic checkpoints" - validation routines that verify preservation of essential properties. Our analysis identifies four primary vortex patterns:
            </p>

            <p>
                (1) <em>Type coercion vortex:</em> Loss of precision through implicit type conversion<br>
                (2) <em>Aggregation vortex:</em> Loss of granularity through premature summarization<br>
                (3) <em>Normalization vortex:</em> Loss of variation through excessive standardization<br>
                (4) <em>Context stripping vortex:</em> Loss of meaning through metadata removal
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Token Budget:</strong> 800Â±150 tokens, allocated to: Core structures (300), Relationships (200), Transformations (150), Validation rules (150).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Validation Criteria:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                - Completeness: All data elements specified with types and constraints<br>
                - Consistency: No contradictory definitions or circular dependencies<br>
                - Traceability: Clear mapping from requirements to data structures<br>
                - Preservation: Semantic checkpoints defined for all transformations
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.4</span> Phase 3: EXPLORATION</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Investigate unknowns through critical inquiry and hypothesis testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theoretical Basis:</strong> Exploratory programming (Sandberg, 1988), hypothesis-driven development (Ries, 2011), and critical making (Ratto, 2011).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Process Specification:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Exploration represents the methodology's most flexible phase, where Vibe Engineering principles fully manifest. Practitioners generate hypotheses about implementation approaches, test assumptions through rapid prototypes, and document discoveries that reshape understanding. The phase operates through iterative cycles:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Hypothesis Generation:</em> Based on Context and Data phases, practitioners formulate testable hypotheses about technical feasibility, performance characteristics, and implementation strategies. Each hypothesis includes success criteria and failure conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Experimental Implementation:</em> Rapid prototypes test hypotheses with minimal investment. LLMs generate experimental code following Vibe Engineering principlesâ€”enough structure for meaningful results without premature optimization.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Discovery Documentation:</em> All findings, whether confirming or refuting hypotheses, are documented with evidence and implications. Negative results prove as valuable as positive outcomes, preventing future repetition of failed approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>CEIL Enhancement:</strong> Critical experts prevent "solutionism"â€”the tendency to become attached to first working solutions. They challenge practitioners to explore alternative approaches, question underlying assumptions, and consider non-technical solutions. CEIL intervention proves particularly valuable when LLMs exhibit overconfidence in generated solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Vibe Engineering Application:</strong> The Exploration phase explicitly embraces the full Vibe spectrum. Initial exploration employs Pure Vibing for divergent thinking, transitions to Guided Vibing as patterns emerge, and concludes with Vibe Engineering to systematize discoveries.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Token Budget:</strong> Variable (300-1500 tokens), dynamically allocated based on discovery complexity and hypothesis count.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Validation Criteria:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Requirements formalization synthesizes insights from previous phases into actionable specifications. The methodology distinguishes four requirement categories:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Functional Requirements:</em> System capabilities expressed as user stories with acceptance criteria. Each requirement includes priority (P0/P1/P2), rationale, and traceability to Context goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Non-Functional Requirements:</em> Quality attributes including performance, usability, security, and maintainability. Specifications include measurable targets and validation methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Epistemic Requirements:</em> Knowledge preservation and interpretation support requirements specific to scholarly applications. These ensure systems maintain interpretive flexibility and scholarly apparatus.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Ethical Requirements:</em> Constraints arising from ethical considerations including privacy, fairness, transparency, and environmental impact.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scholar-Centred Enhancement:</strong> Requirements include provisions for scholarly apparatus: citation mechanisms, provenance tracking, version control, and collaborative annotation. The methodology recognizes that scholarly tools must support not just current research but future reinterpretation.

            <p>
                Implementation planning translates requirements into technical specifications suitable for LLM processing. The phase produces detailed instructions that serve as prompts for code generation while maintaining human readability. Key components include:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Architectural Decisions:</em> Technology stack selection, component boundaries, integration patterns, and deployment strategies. Each decision includes rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs accepted.

            <p>
                <strong>Decision Traceability:</strong> All implementation decisions link to requirements and context goals, creating an audit trail for future maintenance and evolution. This traceability proves essential when requirements change or errors emerge.

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.7</span> Phase 6: PROTOTYPE</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Generate working implementation with interpretive validity and production readiness.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Theoretical Basis:</strong> Rapid prototyping (Naumann & Jenkins, 1982), test-driven development (Beck, 2003), and continuous integration (Fowler, 2006).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Process Specification:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The Prototype phase transforms specifications into executable code through systematic LLM interaction. Unlike ad-hoc code generation, the methodology enforces structured generation with continuous validation:
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Incremental Generation:</em> Code generation proceeds in small, testable increments. Each increment includes implementation, tests, and documentation. This approach prevents the accumulation of errors and enables rapid rollback when issues emerge.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Continuous Validation:</em> Generated code undergoes immediate validation through automated tests, static analysis, and CEIL review. Validation failures trigger targeted regeneration rather than wholesale replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Context Preservation:</em> The methodology maintains semantic continuity from requirements through implementation. Generated code includes comments linking to requirements, preserving traceability.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scholar-Centred Enhancement:</strong> For humanities applications, prototypes include interpretive apparatus: visualization tools, annotation systems, and export formats supporting scholarly workflows. The methodology recognizes that scholarly tools must support exploration and argumentation, not just data processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> The Prototype phase implements multi-layer quality assurance:
            </p>

            <p>
                - Unit tests validating individual components<br>
                - Integration tests verifying component interactions<br>
                - Acceptance tests confirming requirement satisfaction<br>
                - Performance tests ensuring non-functional compliance<br>
                - Security tests identifying vulnerabilities
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Token Budget:</strong> Variable (1000-5000 tokens), scaled to implementation complexity with 20% reserve for iteration.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Validation Criteria:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                - Functional completeness: All requirements implemented and tested<br>
                - Code quality: Metrics within acceptable ranges (complexity, coverage, duplication)<br>
                - Performance compliance: Non-functional requirements satisfied<br>
                - Documentation completeness: Code, API, and user documentation present
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">4.8</span> Savepoint Mechanisms</h3>

            <p>
                The savepoint mechanism, adapted from database transaction theory and distributed systems checkpointing (Chandy & Lamport, 1985), enables risk-free experimentation and recovery from failures. Formal specification:
            </p>

            <div class="equation">
                <p>S<sub>i</sub> = {P<sub>i</sub>, D<sub>i</sub>, M<sub>i</sub>, H<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>i</sub>}</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Where S<sub>i</sub> represents savepoint i, P<sub>i</sub> represents phase state, D<sub>i</sub> represents deliverables, M<sub>i</sub> represents metadata, H<sub>i</sub> represents hash for integrity verification, and T<sub>i</sub> represents timestamp.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Checkpoint Creation Protocol:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Savepoints are created automatically at phase transitions and manually at critical decision points. The creation protocol ensures consistency:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Freeze current state preventing modifications<br>
                2. Calculate cryptographic hash of all artifacts<br>
                3. Store artifacts with metadata in version control<br>
                4. Verify storage integrity through hash comparison<br>
                5. Release state freeze allowing continued development
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Recovery Procedures:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Recovery from savepoints follows a deterministic protocol ensuring system consistency:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Identify target savepoint through timestamp or hash<br>
                2. Verify savepoint integrity through hash validation<br>
                3. Create recovery savepoint of current state<br>
                4. Restore artifacts from target savepoint<br>
                5. Update phase state and metadata<br>
                6. Log recovery event with rationale
            </p>

            <p>
                Our analysis of 89 recovery events reveals that 78% occur during Exploration and Prototype phases, where experimentation risk is highest. Recovery typically completes within 2 minutes, compared to hours or days for traditional debugging and refactoring.

            <p>
                To validate the effectiveness of the Promptotyping methodology, we conducted a mixed-methods study combining controlled experiments with qualitative analysis. The study design addressed three research questions:
            </p>

            <p>
                RQ1: Does Promptotyping improve development productivity compared to traditional and ad-hoc LLM approaches?<br>
                RQ2: How does the methodology affect code quality and maintainability?<br>
                RQ3: What is the impact on developer cognitive load and satisfaction?
            </p>

            <h4>5.1.1 Participants</h4>

            <p>
                We recruited 47 professional software developers through purposive sampling to ensure diverse experience levels and backgrounds. Participant demographics:

The methodology's emphasis on requirements clarity and incremental validation prevented the quality degradation observed in ad-hoc LLM usage. Notably, test coverage improved by 17% compared to traditional development, attributed to the methodology's test-first approach in the Requirements phase.

                Promptotyping reduced overall cognitive load by 24% compared to traditional development and 31% compared to ad-hoc LLM usage. The structured phases distributed cognitive demands, preventing the overwhelming peaks observed in other conditions.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">5.3</span> Qualitative Analysis</h3>

            <p>
                Thematic analysis of interview transcripts (n=20) using Braun and Clarke's (2006) six-phase framework revealed five primary themes:
            </p>

            <h4>5.3.1 Theme 1: Structured Freedom</h4>

            <p>
                Participants described Promptotyping as providing "structured freedom"â€”sufficient guidance to prevent confusion while maintaining creative flexibility:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The phases gave me clear milestones, but within each phase, I had freedom to explore. It's like having guardrails on a mountain roadâ€”you can drive fast because you know you won't go off the cliff." (P7, Senior Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This theme appeared in 17 of 20 interviews, with particular emphasis from senior developers who appreciated the balance between structure and autonomy.
            </p>

            <h4>5.3.2 Theme 2: Confidence Through Savepoints</h4>

            <p>
                The savepoint mechanism emerged as a critical confidence builder, enabling experimentation without fear:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Knowing I could always roll back changed everything. I tried approaches I would never attempt normally because the cost of failure was so low." (P12, Mid-level Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                "In traditional development, I'm always worried about breaking something. With savepoints, I could be bold. It's liberating." (P3, Junior Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                All participants mentioned savepoints positively, with junior developers particularly valuing the safety net they provided.
            </p>

            <h4>5.3.3 Theme 3: Cognitive Clarity</h4>

            <p>
                Participants reported enhanced mental clarity attributed to phase separation:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Usually, I'm juggling requirements, design, and implementation simultaneously. The phases let me focus on one thing at a time. My brain felt... quieter." (P15, Mid-level Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This theme correlated with NASA-TLX scores, where participants reporting greater clarity showed lower cognitive load measurements.
            </p>

            <h4>5.3.4 Theme 4: LLM Relationship Evolution</h4>

            <p>
                Participants described evolving relationships with LLMs through the methodology:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "At first, I treated the LLM like Googleâ€”asking random questions. Promptotyping taught me to treat it like a junior developerâ€”giving clear instructions and checking the work." (P18, Senior Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The Vibe Engineering spectrum provided vocabulary for discussing this evolution, with participants identifying their progression through stages.
            </p>

            <h4>5.3.5 Theme 5: Documentation as Artifact</h4>

            <p>
                The methodology transformed participants' perception of documentation:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I used to see documentation as a chore done after coding. Now I see it as the actual product, with code as just one representation." (P9, Senior Developer)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This shift proved particularly pronounced among participants with humanities backgrounds, who recognized parallels to scholarly writing practices.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">5.4</span> Experience Level Analysis</h3>

            <p>
                Stratified analysis by experience level revealed differential benefits:
            </p>

            <table>
                <thead>

            <p>
                Junior developers benefited most from the methodology's structure, while senior developers valued the efficiency gains and quality improvements. This suggests that Promptotyping provides scaffolding for novices while streamlining expert workflows.

            <h2><span class="section-number">6.</span> Case Study: Stefan Zweig Digital</h2>

            <h3><span class="section-number">6.1</span> Project Context</h3>

            <p>
                The Stefan Zweig Digital project at the University of Salzburg required an XML annotation tool for digital humanities research. The project presented unique challenges combining technical requirements with scholarly practices, making it an ideal test case for Promptotyping's dual epistemological approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Initial Requirements:</strong><br>
                - Support for TEI-XML annotation of literary texts<br>
                - Collaborative editing capabilities for distributed research teams<br>
                - Version control with detailed provenance tracking<br>
                - Integration with existing digital humanities infrastructure<br>
                - Support for complex scholarly apparatus (variants, commentary, references)
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Traditional Approach Estimate:</strong> The university's IT department estimated 2 weeks development time using conventional methods, including database design, authentication system implementation, and multi-user synchronization.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">6.2</span> Promptotyping Application</h3>

            <p>
                The project team, consisting of one digital humanities scholar (domain expert) and one developer familiar with Promptotyping, completed the entire system in 2 hoursâ€”a 98.8% time reduction.
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.1 Phase 1: CONTEXT (5 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                The scholar provided epistemological grounding, emphasizing that the tool must support interpretive flexibility rather than imposing rigid structures. Key context elements:
            </p>

            <p>
                - Epistemological stance: Hermeneutic interpretation privileging multiple valid readings<br>
                - Domain constraints: TEI-XML compliance, scholarly citation standards<br>
                - Success criteria: Usability by humanities scholars without technical training<br>
                - Critical insight: Single-scholar use case (dissertation research) rather than institutional deployment
            </p>

            <p>
                The CEIL intervention proved crucial here. The scholar challenged the assumption of multi-user requirements, revealing that the actual need was personal research tool, not collaborative platform. This insight eliminated 70% of anticipated complexity.
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.2 Phase 2: DATA (10 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                Data analysis revealed that localStorage could satisfy all persistence requirements, eliminating database complexity:
            </p>

            <p>
                - TEI-XML structure analysis identified 12 element types requiring annotation<br>
                - Storage calculation: Maximum 10MB per text, well within localStorage limits<br>
                - Version control simplified to timestamp-based snapshots<br>
                - No server-side processing required, enabling static hosting
            </p>

            <p>
                The scholar's domain expertise prevented over-engineering. Rather than implementing full TEI compliance, only the subset actually used in Zweig scholarship was supported.
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.3 Phase 3: EXPLORATION (20 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                Exploration tested three technical approaches through rapid prototypes:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. <strong>React-based SPA:</strong> Rejected due to unnecessary complexity<br>
                2. <strong>Vanilla JavaScript:</strong> Selected for simplicity and maintainability<br>
                3. <strong>Web Components:</strong> Considered but deemed overengineered
            </p>

            <p>
                CEIL intervention prevented "framework fixation"â€”the tendency to default to complex frameworks. The scholar's question "Can humanities graduates maintain this?" guided toward simplicity.
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.4 Phase 4: REQUIREMENTS (15 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                Requirements crystallized around scholarly workflows rather than technical features:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Functional Requirements:</strong><br>
                - Load TEI-XML files via drag-and-drop<br>
                - Visual highlighting of annotatable elements<br>
                - Modal annotation interface with scholarly apparatus<br>
                - Export annotated XML with proper formatting<br>
                - Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scholar-Centred Requirements:</strong><br>
                - Preserve original text integrity (no normalization)<br>
                - Support uncertain readings with confidence indicators<br>
                - Maintain citation trail for all annotations<br>
                - Enable annotation of annotations (scholarly dialogue)
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.5 Phase 5: IMPLEMENTATION (20 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                Implementation specifications emphasized simplicity and maintainability:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Architecture:</strong><br>
                - Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript<br>
                - Event-driven architecture using DOM APIs<br>
                - localStorage for persistence with JSON serialization<br>
                - No build process or dependencies
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Algorithm specifications:</strong><br>
                - XML parsing using browser's DOMParser<br>
                - XPath for element selection<br>
                - XSLT for export transformation<br>
                - Diff algorithm for version comparison
            </p>

            <h4>6.2.6 Phase 6: PROTOTYPE (50 minutes)</h4>

            <p>
                Claude (Anthropic's LLM) generated the complete implementation following Promptotyping specifications. The systematic approach prevented typical LLM issues:
            </p>

            <p>
                - No hallucinated APIs or non-existent libraries<br>
                - Clean, maintainable code structure<br>
                - Comprehensive error handling<br>
                - Inline documentation linking to requirements
            </p>

            <p>
                The resulting tool comprised 847 lines of code (HTML: 127, CSS: 234, JavaScript: 486) with 94% test coverage.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="section-number">8.</span> Limitations and Future Work</h2>

            <h3><span class="section-number">8.1</span> Limitations</h3>

            <p>
                While our empirical validation demonstrates significant benefits, several limitations constrain generalizability:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Domain Limitations:</strong> Validation focused on web application development, data processing, and algorithm implementation. Applicability to systems programming, embedded systems, real-time systems, and machine learning remains unvalidated. The methodology's emphasis on documentation may prove less suitable for domains requiring extensive experimentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scale Limitations:</strong> Our studies examined projects ranging from 2 hours to 3 weeks duration with teams of 1-5 members. Large-scale projects (>6 months, >20 developers) may require adaptations not yet explored. The savepoint mechanism's scalability to massive codebases requires investigation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>LLM Dependency:</strong> The methodology assumes access to capable LLMs, creating potential barriers: cost constraints for extensive usage, privacy concerns for sensitive domains, availability limitations in restricted environments, and quality variations across different models.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Cultural Limitations:</strong> While we document adaptations across three cultural contexts, many regions remain unexplored. African, South American, and Middle Eastern contexts may reveal additional adaptation requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Skill Development Concerns:</strong> Long-term impacts on developer skill acquisition remain unknown. Preliminary observations suggest potential atrophy of low-level programming skills compensated by enhanced high-level design abilities. Longitudinal studies are necessary to understand career-span implications.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Methodological Limitations:</strong> Our controlled experiments used standardized tasks that may not reflect real-world complexity. Self-selection bias may affect participant pools, as developers interested in LLM technologies may be predisposed to success. The Hawthorne effect potentially inflated performance metrics.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="section-number">8.2</span> Threats to Validity</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Internal Validity:</strong> Confounding variables include participant prior experience with specific LLMs, task familiarity advantages, and learning effects across multiple tasks. We mitigated through randomization and counterbalancing but cannot eliminate all threats.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>External Validity:</strong> Generalizability limitations include overrepresentation of web technologies, Western cultural contexts, and English-language development. The methodology may perform differently with non-English prompts and culturally diverse teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Construct Validity:</strong> Our productivity metrics may not capture all relevant dimensions. Code quality metrics, while standard, may not reflect maintainability accurately. Cognitive load measurements rely on self-report with inherent limitations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion Validity:</strong> Statistical power analysis confirms adequate sample size for main effects but marginal power for interaction effects. Multiple comparisons increase Type I error risk despite corrections.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="section-number">9.</span> Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                This paper presented Promptotyping Version 3.0, a comprehensive methodology for LLM-assisted software development that addresses the "promptware crisis" through systematic integration of engineering rigor and critical humanities perspectives. The methodology's theoretical foundation, grounded in cognitive load theory, information theory, and dual epistemological traditions, provides a robust framework for human-AI collaboration in software development.
            </p>

            <p>
                The empirical validation demonstrates substantial improvements across multiple dimensions: 55% productivity increase, 23% error reduction, and 24% cognitive load decrease compared to traditional approaches. The Stefan Zweig Digital case study's 98.8% time reduction, while exceptional, illustrates the methodology's transformative potential when conditions align.
            </p>

            <p>
                The introduction of Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop (CEIL) represents a paradigm shift from passive validation to active trajectory shaping, preventing AI sycophancy while preserving human expertise. The Vibe Engineering spectrum provides vocabulary and structure for the evolution from intuitive to systematic LLM interaction, acknowledging that different contexts require different approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                International adoption across diverse cultural contextsâ€”from Silicon Valley engineering firms to Austrian digital humanities centersâ€”demonstrates the methodology's adaptability while maintaining core principles. The successful synthesis of American efficiency-focus and German-Austrian theoretical depth suggests that Promptotyping can bridge traditionally disparate approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, we acknowledge significant limitations. The methodology's applicability beyond validated domains remains uncertain, long-term skill development impacts require investigation, and fundamental challenges around attribution, expertise, and sustainability persist. These limitations define a research agenda for the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                The implications extend beyond immediate productivity gains. Promptotyping represents a fundamental reconceptualization of software development as a human-AI collaborative process where documentation becomes primary and code derivative. This shift challenges established practices, educational approaches, and professional identities.
            </p>

            <p>
                As LLMs continue evolving, methodologies for their integration become increasingly critical. Promptotyping Version 3.0 provides a foundationâ€”theoretically grounded, empirically validated, and practically applicableâ€”for this integration. Yet it represents a beginning, not an end. The methodology must evolve with technology, practices, and understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                We conclude with a call to action for the software engineering community: embrace systematic approaches to LLM integration while maintaining critical perspective, preserve and enhance human expertise while leveraging AI capabilities, and contribute to the methodology's evolution through application, adaptation, and advancement. The future of software development lies not in replacing human creativity with artificial intelligence but in synthesizing both through methodologies like Promptotyping that honor the contributions of each.
            </p>

            <p>
                The journey from ad-hoc prompt engineering to systematic methodology parallels software engineering's own evolution from craft to discipline. Promptotyping Version 3.0 represents one step in this evolutionâ€”significant but not final. The methodology's ultimate success depends not on its current form but on its capacity to evolve, adapt, and improve through community engagement and critical application.
